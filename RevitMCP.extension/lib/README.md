# This is a conceptual lib folder. 
# For the pyRevit extension to find your RevitMCP_UI and RevitMCP_RevitListener modules,
# you would either:
# 1. Add the path to your 'RevitMCPv2' project (C:\Users\jacob\Desktop\ACS\Programming\RevitMCPv2) 
#    to pyRevit's script search paths or to sys.path in each button script.
# 2. Copy the 'RevitMCP_UI' and 'RevitMCP_RevitListener' folders into this 'lib' directory.
#    (Make sure they have their __init__.py files)

# For now, this file is just a placeholder.
